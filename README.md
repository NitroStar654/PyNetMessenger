## Overview

PyNetMessenger provides a simple client-server setup that enables communication between two devices on the same network.
The sender sends messages, while the receiver listens for incoming messages on a specified port.

This project is great for learning about Python socket programming and basic networking concepts.

## Installation

Make sure Python 3 is installed on both devices (sender and receiver). This project does not have any external
dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NitroStar654/PyNetMessenger.git
cd PyNetMessenger
```

## Usage

### Sender Usage

The `sender.py` script allows you to send messages to the receiver.

#### Running sender.py

```bash
python sender.py -i <Destination IP> -p <Destination Port>
```

#### Example:

```bash
python sender.py -i 192.168.0.25 -p 5215
You will send messages to 192.168.0.25:5215
Message to send: Hello!
```

You will then be able to type a message, which will be sent to the receiver at the specified IP and port.

### Receiver Usage

The `receiver.py` script sets up the receiver to listen for incoming messages.

#### Running receiver.py

```bash
python receiver.py -p <Listener Port>
```

#### Example:

```bash
python receiver.py -p 5215
Listening on 0.0.0.0:5215... Press Ctrl+C to exit
[20/10/2024 20:49:23 UTC] 192.168.0.20:5215 â†’ Hello!
```

The server will then listen on the specified port, waiting for messages from the sender. The default 0.0.0.0 address is
used to listen on all network interfaces.
